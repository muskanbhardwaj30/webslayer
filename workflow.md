1. USER INPUT ->  URL
2. URL PROCESSING:
    1. HASH CREATION OF URL
    2. USING HASH WE CREATED MARKDOWN FILE(WITH HASH AS NAME IN THE `.CACHE` FOLDER)
    3. CRAWLING OF URL PAGE(USING ADVERTOOLS)
    4. WE GOT JSON(LD) FORMAT DATA
    5. READ IT USING THE `pd.read_json(JSON(LD))`
    6. WE GOT THE DATA IN THE PANDAS DATAFRAME
    7. DATA POST PROCESSING
    8. POST PROCESSING:
        1. REMOVE DUPLICATE DATA(DROPPING OF PANDAS LIBRARY)
        2. BASED ON {URL+DATA} WE CREATED HASH FOR REMOVING DUPLICATE DATA
        3. WE USED FULL HTML IF AVAILABLE ESLE WE WILL USE THE BODY TEXT
        4. WE CREATED THE MARKDOWN FROM THE DATA(USING MARKDOWNIFY LIBRARY)
        5. WE FORMATTED THE MARKDOWN(USING MDFORMAT LIBRARY)
    9. WE WRITE THE MARKDOWN TO THE SAME HASH FILE WE CREATED IN THE STARTING OF PROCESS
    10. ALSO WE STORED THE MARKDOWN DATA INO A VARIABLE
    11. WE SAVED THE MARKDOWN DATA INTO THE CACHE ALSO USING THE HASH FILE CREATED
    12. RETURNED THE `URL_HASH` & `MARKDOWN`
3. WEBSITE LOADED INTO THE MARKDOWN CACHE
4. USER WILL BE INFORMED THAT WEBSITE IS LOADED
5. USER CAN ASK THE QUERIES
6. AFTER THIS `USER QUERY + WEBSITE DATA + CHAT HISTORY` WILL BE PASSED INTO LLM FUNCTION
7. NOW USING THE PROMPT LLM WILL ANSWER THE QUERY (LLM IS GEMINI GEMMA-3N MODEL)
8. LLM ANSWER WILL BE RETURNED TO THE USER
9. ANSWER WILL BE SHOWN IN THE CHATBOX AND USER CAN ASK MULTIPLE QUESTIONS REALTED TO THAT WEBPAGE
10. NOW THE CACHE WILL BE USED EVERY TIME USER FETCHES THE SAME WEBSITE INSTEAD OF RE-FETCHING OF THE WEBSITE
